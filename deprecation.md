You will **not** be able to use text commands from April 15th, 2022.
Please reinvite the bot using the link in the『Invite』command.
Then switch to Slash Commands by pressing slash (`/`) on your keyboard.

Discord decided to make the Message Content Intent a privileged one.
Which means, PokeGambler can't read the messages being sent in the channels.
Hence, PokeGambler is now switching to Slash Commands as recommended by Discord.
Discord's reasoning behind such a move is to enforce stronger privacy control.

# Things that will change:
1. Text commands aka messages starting with the『%prefix%』prefix won't work.
2. PokeGambler needs to be re-invited using the link in the『Invite』command.
> The new link uses an additional scope to enable Slash Commands.
3. PokeGambler will now switch to Slash Commands.
You can use the commands by pressing the forward slash key (/) on your keyboard and typing them.
4. Command Aliases will be deprecated.
E.g., you cannot use Flip for Quickflip.
> Slash commands have auto-complete feature.
> So you just need to start typing the original command.
