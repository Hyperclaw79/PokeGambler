## Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in our projects!

If you are interested in contributing, **this page contains the golden rules to follow when contributing**.
Do note that failing to comply with our guidelines may lead to a rejection of the contribution.

If you are confused by any of these rules, feel free to ask us in the `#general` channel in [PokeGambler's Den](https://discord.gg/g4TmVyfwj4).

## The Golden Rules of Contributing
1. **Lint before you push.** We have simple but strict style rules that are enforced through linting.
You must always lint your code using `Pylint` and `Pycodestyle`.
2. **Make great commits**. Great commits should be atomic, with a commit message explaining what and why.
3. **Use assets licensed for public use**. Whenever the assets are images, audio or even code, they must have a license compatible with our projects.
4. **Use Links wherever Relevant**. If your pull request fixes a bug in a particular Issue, make sure to link them.
5. **Pin the requirements**. If your code changes use any 3rd party libraries, mention them in the `requirements.txt` and pin to the version you've tested it on.
